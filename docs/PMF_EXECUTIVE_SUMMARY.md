# Percepta PMF Analysis - Executive Summary

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Post-MVP Assessment

---

## TL;DR

**PMF Score: 3.8/10** ⚠️

Percepta has **strong technology** but **weak product-market fit**. The RAG system works well (84% accuracy, <5s latency), but critical business elements are missing:

- ❌ No defined customer segment
- ❌ No business model or pricing
- ❌ No customer validation
- ❌ No go-to-market strategy

**Recommendation**: Focus on **mid-tier streamers (100-5K viewers)** as primary segment. Launch beta in 30 days with freemium pricing model.

---

## Current State

### ✅ Strengths
- **Technology**: Solid RAG system, real-time transcription, event tracking
- **Performance**: <5s latency, 84% answer accuracy, ~$0.01/hour cost
- **Architecture**: Scalable, well-designed, ready for production

### ❌ Gaps
- **Business Model**: No pricing, no revenue model
- **Customer Validation**: Haven't talked to potential customers
- **Go-to-Market**: No distribution strategy
- **Value Messaging**: Unclear why customers should care

---

## Market Opportunity

**Target Segment**: Mid-Tier Streamers (100-5K avg viewers)
- **Market Size**: ~140,000 channels globally
- **Willingness to Pay**: $10-50/month
