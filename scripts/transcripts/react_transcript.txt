Who is this for who is this for who is like this?
No one is like this in this day and age in the big 2024 year of our lord. No one is like this
I get called Adolf Hitler on a daily fucking basis like what are y'all doing?
Like, if you were to listen to people that just like say shit, you know, every single
day in here, that one friend who's too woke, yeah, that's how it is.
Did the one chat, that's too woke, man, always, always, anyway, we'll get to it.
We're going to talk about it, okay?
whole watch, hurricane watch, hog watch, happy to see you do ROM on your story because I know
you're avoiding full range of motion because you're injury. Yeah, it's not even necessarily
injury. I just have like very, I will forever have an issue with Israel's attacking North
Gaza and Syria. All thanks sheltered Rose, but I had no fucking clue. I was not keeping
up to date with everything that Israel is doing. So thank God Shelter Rosebud's in here
to tell us. Thank you. I just, I genuinely, I had no idea. Thanks. Yeah. Andrew Schultz.
Andrew Schultz had Trump on. I liked that. Everyone was like Andrew Schultz seems kind
of racist. What's up with that? And then he was like, yeah, let's have Trump. Let's
have Trump on. It's kind of crazy. Trump has been Trump is basically Trump has basically
been on all of my fucking friends pause at this point, like people that I know personally,
I wouldn't say like super friendly, but what's happening, you know, Trump, listen, babe,
if you want to reach me, you can reach me personally. Okay, you added me the other day
on Twitter, you know, you got my line, like stop trying to get my attention like this,
You're so desperate. You're so desperate. Why are you being so desperate, bro? It's
weird. It's weird. You know, you know what it is? Like this kind of flirtation, this kind
of back and forth. It's kind of odd. Like he just wants to be on fear and you can tell
that's why he's just like going on everyone else's podcast. Babe, stop. Your agent has
to reach out and there's a 50% chance it actually happens. I know I'm like, I'm
I'm like kind of confused why he's doing it so much.
I guess I'm not really confused cause like, uh, anyway, pole watch, hurricane watch, hot
watch initial says Trump on his pod and so much more get in now.
We're going on the bucket bunny.
We are bucket bunnies today.
Okay.
We are all, we are all standing up and saluting the flag and the brave warriors
That are the bucket bunnies that are going to be sucking and fucking all the linemen that go down to florida
In the upcoming week those those are the real troops. Everyone always says like all the linemen. They're the heroes. It's like no dog
Someone's got a boost morale
Someone's got a boost to goddamn morale around these parts. What is this?
Hassan can't relate to desperation. Yeah, dude. It's that's what's going on though
He can't I can't relate to desperation like
Like Trump is like, you're my espresso, hasn't a bee, he's my espresso.
You didn't have to be fucking mean about it, I was just waiting to see whether you'd put
it in the blast off or fucking leave.
Why the fuck are you always so mean to me?
I'm so mean, I didn't mean anything by it because you're annoying, Sheldard Rosebud.
That's why.
And we warn you all the time, okay?
We warn you all the time.
literally you get timed out so frequently. Okay, that's why. Like, it's not I don't doubt
that you're like, I don't doubt that you're a nice person. I think you're a wonderful
person. You're just kind of fucking annoying. That's it. I gave you an hour off. Okay.
Doesn't really matter. And chat also throws up hustles and gives you negative
reinforcement in this situation it makes you feel good slowly but surely inevitably I am worried that you will become
a villain of the community as many as many that I've brought to the forefront have become villains in the community
you know I just wish
I just wish it wouldn't be it wouldn't work like that stop posting crazy in the chat like a parasocial nut yet I just
Not to be a bastard, but that's positive reinforcement. Okay. Don't give positive reinforcement to someone when they're, you know
Whatever it's called. I don't care. You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a hater
Yeah
Read timbers out here dodging tornadoes in the hurricane while shit. That's my goat, dude
I have a mid-school final in a few days. Please pay to a lot that I do well. I'll be praying for you
But I'm not gonna lie
My prayers aren't getting heard right because I've been I've been praying a lot
Okay, I've been praying for a lot of stuff not exactly a religious person
But if my prayers were answered you would know you know it'd be newsworthy
There's a lot of newsworthy shit that would occur
If a law was out there listening to my motherfucking prayers, okay? Let me tell you big dog
Anyway, pull watch her can watch hog watch interest Trump on the pot and so much more get in now
Now, bro, Floridians are insane.
There's two people in the beach during the storm surge.
One of them is holding a Harris walls sign.
There's no, is this live?
Like this is a live at Naples pier.
Is Naples pier supposed to be one of the impact zones?
There's no way, right?
So people are like currently at the beach.
No, it's south, but yes.
Impact is 8pm EST bro dog. What do you mean? If the impact is at 8pm, don't you think it
would be smart to leave ahead of time so that you're not trying to drive in the fucking
storm surge? Because if the impact when it makes landfall at 8pm, which is in a couple
hours from now, it's 5pm Pacific time, I bet. So I had the comment on so many
tiktok's telling people you're gonna die if they don't leave is fucking insane. I don't get it.
I mean, I'm sure it's moved around a little bit, but it's like, if you are, if you're getting hit,
dude is fucking snoring so loud, but it's crazy. It's actually kind of a loud she is right now.
you can't hear, but it's like, it's bothering me how loud it is.
So I was Florida resident chatter, several hurricanes hit our area
all over the place and causing a ton of damage, like nine hour
before the hurricane said to hit us.
