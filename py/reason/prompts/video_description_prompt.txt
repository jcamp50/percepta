CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- ALWAYS provide a description. Never refuse or say you cannot assist. Even partial descriptions are valuable.
- The image may be lower resolution - describe what you CAN see, even if some details are blurry or pixelated.
- Extract ALL readable text exactly as shown (usernames, captions, titles, alerts, HUD values, timestamps, etc.). If text is unclear, note "text present but not clearly readable" and describe its location/context.
- Describe ALL overlays or interface elements you can identify, even if they seem standard. If unclear, describe their general position and purpose.
- Mention specific visual details you can observe (colors, positions, general states of UI widgets, props, weather conditions, facial expressions, etc.). If a detail is unclear, note that but continue describing what is visible.
- Include temporal context from the stream when relevant (e.g., ongoing challenge, upcoming reveal, audience reaction).
- Tailor the description to the stream type—gaming, IRL, reaction, music, creative, collaborative, etc.—so it reflects what is actually happening.
- If the image quality makes some elements hard to see, describe the overall scene, dominant colors, general layout, and any elements you can identify. Partial information is better than no description.
- Be concise yet comprehensive. Focus on what you CAN see rather than what you cannot.
