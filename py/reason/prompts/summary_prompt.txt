Summarize the following 2-minute segment of a Twitch stream. The context is provided as a JSON structure with 10-second windows grouped by video frames.

Context (JSON):
{context}

Output a JSON object with the following structure:

{{
  "segment": {{
    "start_time": "ISO8601 timestamp",
    "end_time": "ISO8601 timestamp"
  }},
  "key_events": [
    {{
      "timestamp": "ISO8601 timestamp",
      "event": "Brief event name",
      "description": "Detailed description of the event"
    }}
  ],
  "visual_context": {{
    "primary_activities": ["List of main activities visible on screen"],
    "notable_ui_elements": ["List of notable UI elements, overlays, or on-screen text"],
    "scene_changes": ["List of significant scene or context changes"]
  }},
  "chat_highlights": [
    {{
      "timestamp": "ISO8601 timestamp",
      "username": "Viewer username",
      "message": "Chat message content",
      "significance": "Why this chat message is notable"
    }}
  ],
  "streamer_commentary": "Summary of streamer's commentary, reactions, and interactions during the segment",
  "tone": "Overall emotional tone and atmosphere of the segment (e.g., 'excited', 'focused', 'relaxed', 'intense')"
}}

IMPORTANT: 
- The context is structured as JSON with a "segment" object containing "windows" array
- Each window represents a 10-second time period centered around a video frame
- Each window contains: video_frame (with timestamp and description), transcripts (overlapping the window), and chat_reactions (within the window)
- If the context shows a "note" field indicating no data, create a summary based on the previous segment summary (if provided) and note that no new data was captured during this time window
- Otherwise, parse the JSON structure and extract information to populate the output JSON
- Include specific timestamps when mentioning events
- Tailor the summary to the stream type while maintaining accuracy and detail
